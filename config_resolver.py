"""
A config resolver for python.

Usage::

    from config_resolver import Config
    conf = Config('mycompany', 'myapplication')

Crating the config object will not raise an error. Instead it will return a
valid, but empty :py:class:`.Config` instance. In order to determine whether
any config file was loaded, you can look into the ``loaded_files`` instance
variable. It contains a list of all the loaded files, in the order of loading.
If that list is empty, no config has been found.

Additionally, another instance variable named ``active_path`` represents the
search path after processing of environment variables and runtime parameters.
This may be useful to display user-errors, or debugging.

The resolver parses config files according to the default python
``ConfigParser`` (i.e. ``ini`` files).

    :param search_path: if specified, set the config search path to the
        given value. The path can use OS specific separators (f.ex.: ``:``
        on posix, ``;`` on windows) to specify multiple folders. These
        folders will be searched in the specified order. The config files
        will be loaded incrementally. This means that the each subsequent
        config file will extend/override existing values. This means that
        the last file will take precedence.
    :param filename: if specified, this can be used to override the
        configuration filename (default=``"app.ini"``)
    :param group_name: an application group (f. ex.: your company name)
    :param app_name: an application identifier (f.ex.: the application
                     module name)

    Environment Variables
    ---------------------

    The resolver can also be manipulated using environment variables to
    allow different values for different running instances:

    <app_name>_PATH
        The search path of config files. ``<app_name>`` is the application
        name in all caps. See the documentation for the ``search_path``
        parameter for an explanation of precedence.

        If the path is prefixed with ``+``, then the path is *appended* to the
        default search path. This is the recommended way to specify the path,
        as it will not short-circuit the existing lookup logic.

    <app_name>_CONFIG
        The file name of the config file (default=``"app.ini"``)
